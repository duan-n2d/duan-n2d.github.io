## About Me

I'm a third-year student with a strong passion for data analysis and business intelligence. My journey in the world of data started with a curiosity for uncovering hidden insights and patterns within datasets. Over time, this curiosity has grown into a full-fledged passion for coding and working with data.

I am proficient in Python, which I use for various data analysis tasks, including data cleaning, visualization, and building machine learning models. Additionally, I have experience using Power BI for creating insightful and interactive data dashboards that help drive business decisions.

My dream is to become a skilled data analyst who can leverage data to solve complex problems and provide actionable insights. I am constantly learning and exploring new tools and techniques to enhance my skills in this ever-evolving field.
